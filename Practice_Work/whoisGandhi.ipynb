Oh, the \"non-violent protest\" part is key. Maybe compare it to a modern situation for humor. Like saying he was the OG influencer with sit-ins and salt marches. That's catchy and funny. Let me check if that's accurate enough. Yeah, he did lead the Salt March. And the part about having more chutzpah than a dosa – dosa is a popular Indian dish, so that's a relatable joke. Make sure it's respectful but light-hearted. Okay, that should work.\n",
